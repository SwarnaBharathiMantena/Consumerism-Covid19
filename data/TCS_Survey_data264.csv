Governments will have their system of social secutiry and medical network in place. It would be better if Governments review it and updates on regular basis in view of frequent health threats. But every individual should have his own emergency arrangements.
Most sufferings are from loss of income and medical emergencies. One should try to plan for it on regular basis through available platforms of savings and insurance like products, providing a emergency savings atleast for 6-12months time period. Once it is done, keep reviewing regularly as per family needs, then only one should move to spending some portion of income on life & style consumerism during and post Covid19 situation and like that.

That helps to build immunity!
The biggest impact I would say is on traveling. We love traveling and visiting different countries to experience different cultures and food. And we are not able to do that this year so far. So hope things come back to normalcy to be able to travel like before pandemic started.",,

However due to the nature of the capitalist economy and the pressure on measurement of performance on the basis of revenue growth/GDP for countries, top economies of the world will find a way to induce newer consumer behaviors that are fueled by post covid world. Think of a slew of products and services that do not require you to go out and meet people. Think of luxury items that provide you similar experiences at home as in real physical world. 
Think of Virtual tours, virtual vacations, virtual education etc. While that may be good for consumers in some areas, it may cause a newer set of mental health problems.

Few industries that I believe really need to re evaluate their business model would be travel transportation and hospitality industry. ",,
